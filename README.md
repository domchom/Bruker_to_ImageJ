This workflow was written to batch import Bruker Files into ImageJ formats. It also imports the frame rate and the pixel size (assuming you set the correct objective.)

As of 230229, this is working for Files saved on the SFC, but I have not tested the Bock confocal.
will likely only work with timeseries, not just zstack, simgle images
will need to have the MIP saved already from the scope
also will work with 2 channels, have not tested if one channel works. But should work for unlimited number of channels, have not tested
